# Low-Level Hardware Control
This repo has some code where I practice controlling hardware systems with low-level programming in assembly code.

## button_timer_isr
In this program, a Basic Computer System for the Altera DE0 Board is programmed to flash the upper 5 LEDs every 0.25 seconds and to respond to a push button to toggle the lowest LED. This demonstrates the use of hardware interrupts for both the timer and pushbutton on the parallel port. The code is written in accordance with the Intel Altera documentation and follows the Nios II assembly language conventions.
